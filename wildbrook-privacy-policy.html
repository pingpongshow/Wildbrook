        <div class="privacy-highlight">
            <p><strong>Privacy First:</strong> Your privacy is our priority. All Wildbrook apps are designed with privacy at their core. We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal information. Everything stays on your device, under your control.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Wildbrook ("we," "our," or "us") develops mobile applications for iOS. This Privacy Policy applies to all apps published by Wildbrook on the Apple App Store and explains our approach to user privacy.</p>

        <h2>1. Our Privacy Commitment</h2>

        <p>Wildbrook is committed to protecting your privacy. Our apps are designed with a "privacy-first" philosophy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Data Collection:</strong> We do not collect any personal information from our users</li>

            <li><strong>No Tracking:</strong> We do not track your activity, behavior, or location</li>
            <li><strong>No Third Parties:</strong> We do not share data with third parties because we don't have any data to share</li>
            <li><strong>Local Storage Only:</strong> All app data remains on your device</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>

        <p>Wildbrook apps do not collect, transmit, or store any of the following:</p>

        <h3>iCloud Sync (If Applicable)</h3>

            <li>You can disable iCloud sync at any time in your device settings</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Location Services</h2>

        <p>Some of our apps may request access to your device's location services to provide location-based functionality. When location services are used:</p>

            <li>Location data is never shared with third parties</li>
            <li>Location data is only used for the specific feature you're using</li>
            <li>You can disable location access at any time in Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Device Permissions</h2>

            <li><strong>Files:</strong> To save or open documents (stays on your device or your chosen cloud service)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You can manage all permissions in your device Settings > [App Name].</p>

        <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>

        <p>Wildbrook apps do not integrate with third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. We do not use:</p>

            <li>Facebook SDK or advertising networks</li>
            <li>Crash reporting services</li>
            <li>Any other third-party SDKs that collect data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Apple In-App Purchases</h2>

        <p>Some of our apps may offer in-app purchases through Apple's In-App Purchase system. When you make a purchase:</p>

            <li>The transaction is processed entirely by Apple</li>

            <li>We only receive confirmation that a purchase was made (no personal or payment details)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>

        <p>Our apps do not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. Because we don't collect any data, our apps are safe for users of all ages.</p>

        <p>Parents can confidently allow their children to use our apps knowing that no personal information is collected, stored, or shared.</p>

        <h2>9. Data Security</h2>

        <p>Since we do not collect, transmit, or store any user data on our servers, there is no risk of your data being breached or compromised through our services.</p>

        <p>Any data stored on your device is protected by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Apple's iOS security features</li>
            <li>Your device passcode/biometric authentication</li>
            <li>iOS encryption when your device is locked</li>
        </ul>

        </ul>

        <h2>11. International Users</h2>

        <p>Because we do not collect or transfer any user data, there are no cross-border data transfers to be concerned about. All data remains on your device, regardless of where you are located.</p>

        <h2>12. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our apps or legal requirements. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.</p>

        <p>Since we don't collect user contact information, we cannot notify you directly of changes. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>

        <p>Your continued use of our apps after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>13. Legal Compliance</h2>

        <p>Our privacy practices comply with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>GDPR</strong> (European Union): We don't collect personal data, so GDPR obligations related to data processing don't apply</li>

            <li><strong>COPPA</strong> (Children's Privacy): We don't collect information from children because we don't collect information from anyone</li>
            <li><strong>Apple App Store Guidelines:</strong> Our apps meet Apple's privacy requirements</li>
